# Dashboard in a Day (DIAD) - Power BI Project

This repository contains the Power BI report I created during the **Dashboard in a Day - Online Workshop**.

The workshop provided hands-on experience with Power BI, covering data import, transformation, modeling, visualization, and report publishing. This project showcases my ability to connect to data sources, transform data, build a data model, and create interactive visualizations.

## Learning Objectives
Through this workshop, I learned how to:
1. Connect to, import, and transform data from diverse sources.
2. Build a Power BI data model, create relationships, and add visualizations.
3. Use DAX measures, hierarchies, and create date tables for deeper analysis.
4. Design and publish a complete report with conditional formatting, custom themes, and mobile views.
5. Share dashboards, collaborate with users, and access reports on mobile devices.
